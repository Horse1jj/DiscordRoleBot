# DiscordRoleBot
This Discord Bot allows you to simply add roles to a mentioned user. This bot is extremely good for whitelisting features and simple mentioning things

I would LOVE if you can give me credit in bots description! Not needed but it would be appreciated!

Version 1.2
- Changed @user to user, can just type the user and it will give the role.
